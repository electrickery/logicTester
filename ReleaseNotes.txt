Added to version 1.3 (2020-10-10):

Arduino code:
- Exercise command E:p (p is the I.C. pin number) for one pin (500ms cycle)
- Power switching for 14-pin I.C.s with a P-channel MosFet
- Debug command D:n (1 = on, 0 is off)


Fixed in version 1.2 (2020-10-08):

- Ignored NC pins.
  Each unused exercise pin doubles the number of mutations, for the 7430 the 
  difference is 2048 : 256, a factor 8
- Tested actual XOR function: 7486 working
- Added more I.C.s
- Converted config file format to full JSON
- Fixed 16 pin mapping
- Changed the response for query pins from 0/1 to H/L making the output more readable, 
  very handy for debugging new boolean logic definitions
- Changed the Baud rate, as 1024 and up permutations takes quite a while.


Fixed in version 1.1 (2020-10-05):
- Add more I.C. definitions and test them
