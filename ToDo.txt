ToDo:

- Add more I.C. definitions,
- Test actual XOR function,
- Add automatic switching for the power pin,
- Add support for 20-pin I.C.s,
- Add supported for tri-state and open-collector pins,
- Add notation and support for clock type signals and stateful I.C.s.

Note these are optional functions, not something I am working on yet.
