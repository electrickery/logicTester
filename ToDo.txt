ToDo:

- Add more I.C. definitions and test them,

- Add automatic switching for the power pin,
- Add support for 20-pin I.C.s,
- Add support for testing tri-state and open-collector pins,
- Add notation and support for clock type signals and stateful I.C.s,
- Add 'quick-mode' which assumes gates are isolated,
- Consider 2k2 resistors between Arduino and test-pins, reducing risks of destroying I.C.s.

Note these are optional functions, not something I am working on yet.
